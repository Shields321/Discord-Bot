# Discord-Bot
just trying to make a discord bot

StartUp.py is the file you need to run for the Bot to work. if you don't use StartUp.py to start then the $Stop command will not work.
Also if you change the name of MelusineBot.py you would need to change it in the Startup.py code. if you dont then the bot wont run.
